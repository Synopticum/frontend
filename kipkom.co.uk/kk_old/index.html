	        							<p>There is a thing you need to make your team-building events, corporate parties, promo-actions and informal conversations with your business partners successful.  It makes the atmosphere friendlier and also leaves a recognizable sign which is able to remind your partners, clients or employees of the image you would like your company to correspond with.  It is all about a gift.</p>

	        							<p><strong>How can a gift help you in your promotion?</strong></p>

	        							<p>Presentation of gifts and prizes is a very special and very effective method of promotion.  Everybody loves gifts. Getting a gift makes a recipient cherish kindly feelings about the grantor. Your clients become more loyal while your business partners treat you more favorably and your employees receive added evidence that they are lucky to work in such a caring company.</p>

	        							<p>Note that when you present a gift it does not look like a promotion. It is not at all obtrusive. Thanks to that, “gifts method” happens to appear even more effective than most kinds of direct promotion you can use.</p>

	        							<p><strong>What a correct gift should be</strong></p>

	        							<p>A gift or a prize should be unusual and special to cause the right effect.  It is especially good if you choose a congratulations gift set.</p>

	        							<p><strong>Development of CMS and interactive websites</strong></p>

	        							<p>What purposes do interactive websites serve to? Interactive websites provide broad opportunities to their owners; therefore they can be used as effective business tools. That is why interactive website are demanded primarily by the companies aiming to declare their existence on the Internet and receive response from the prospective customers and business partners. Interactive business websites become a source of profit for companies, as they actively attract customers due to the convenient interface.</p>

	        							<p>Development of an interactive website by our company begins with the specification of its targets and concept. Regardless of the type of site, it should have a design developed specially for it, components of "interactivity" and content (text, image, audio). After that it is tested and posted on the Internet. Any interactive website needs maintenance, promotion and development.</p>

	        							<p>Interactive websites usually belong to online stores, but an interactive corporate website, an interactive information portal also can be created, it all depends on the goals of the customer, his preferences and desires. Websites for online shopping have their own peculiarities of development. Essential elements of shopping website structure are: catalog of the company’s products, exclusive design and shopping cart. Home page of that site more often informs visitors about new products, special offers and promotion events. All information about the products – description, price, availability, discounts, and terms of delivery – is described on the site. Also it is possible to track the status of your order.<br />
	        							The advantages of online stores:</p>

	        							<span class="ul">
	        								<span class="li">they cover larger audience than real stores</span>
	        								<span class="li">relatively low cost of creation and maintenance </span>
	        								<span class="li">Search on these sites is easy and convenient</span>
	        								<span class="li">Fast implementation of changes in the range of products in the online store </span>
	        								<span class="li">easy order processing – it does not take much time</span>
	        								<span class="li">Notices about orders are sent to the administrator’s email</span>
	        							</span>

	        							<p>Corporate portals which were designed as interactive websites also have a great number of advantages, as they allows to interact with customers, receive their comments about goods and services. Similarly, through interactive websites necessary statistic information for the future marketing researches and advertising campaigns can be collected. While developing high quality interactive website various polls and surveys should be considered in its structure.</p>

	        							<p>Interactive websites also have a play component, which can interest the user, and, therefore, attract the attention even of non-target audience. That is an important advantage for many commercial and non-commercial websites.</p>

	        							<p>Our company also provides Content Management Systems (CMS) for websites. There are several CMS which are used by our company:</p>

	        							<p><strong>Maintenance of a main site and creation of a minisite (services, special offers, landing pages, blogs, wiki)</strong>

	        							<p>Minisite is a secondary site, aimed at the improvement of a main site position in search engines or, in case of absence of the main website, at advertisement of products and services of a company on the Internet. Multiple minisites can be built on several different services.<br />The main features and advantages of minisites consist in the fact that they require little or no promotion and are well indexed by search engines. Visitors will come to your minisites and order your products and services. In addition, on any minisite a link to your main website can be placed; this will improve its position in search engines and increase traffic to the main website.</p>

	        							<p>Also our company offers services for site promotion in terms of minisites building. Usually, the promotion of sites is used to attract customers to the new products. When a company has a big website where all the products are specified, the customer will have difficulties in identification of new products, special offers among this variety. As a result, new trends may remain unclaimed. In this case the minisite will be entirely devoted to the new product and won’t escape the attention of customers.</p>

	        							<p>Landing Pages are web pages created specifically in order to prompt the user to perform the desired action: make an order, sign up, download or subscribe to the content. Users make a decision to stay on a website or to leave it just in a few seconds after clicking on the link. While creating a Landing Page our company pays special attention to the information on it. We prepare thematic images, write attractive content, work out the location of links and buttons. This approach significantly increases the frequency of target actions committed by a visitor. And as a result this reduces a number of users who visit the page but don’t understand its content.</p>

	        							<p>Search engine marketing (SEM) is a form of marketing which consists in the promotion of websites through internet advertising and optimization. The main aim of search engine marketing is to get targeted audience traffic on the website. The methods of search engine marketing include all methods which help to solve this problem, from the direct attraction of targeted traffic from less relevant site locations to inner website improvement aiming at the increasing of website relevance for the target audience (thereby increasing visibility in search engines due to the transfer of the results in favor of this website).

	        								<span class="li">Search engine optimization (SEO) is a set of actions designed to change the website and elements of its interface in order to get high rankings in organic search results for a request given.</span>
	        							</span>
